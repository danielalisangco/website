            <h6>Director</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">
              <br>
              My project focuses on the topic of religion and one's devotion, technically still a Catholic, I have chosen my own religion to craft a film on and outline some of the positives and negatives of following on such religion. All I aimed to do was to explore this theme with the least amount of bias possible, by making it a double perspective, with each character meeting their respective conclusion that helps them grow into a better person.
              <br><br>
              Obviously, with my limited resources and time, as well as the time-limit being under three minutes, I am unable to fully explore in-depth the behemoth that is Religion. Furthermore, it is a shame that the camera settings were accidentally changed for at least one quarter of the entire film, severely downgrading the experience of those scenes.
              <br><br>
              Overall, I am somewhat satisfied with the end result or at least the script as I am sure that I have been able to get the point across. Of course, I am a bit disappointed in the quality of some of the shots, and lighting could have been reworked, especially in the beach scenes.
              <br><br>
              If I were to remake the film, I would also definitely look over my script more, storyboard and get a better idea of what I want the characters to sound like. I will also take into account how I would like to edit it post-production and cater my script and filming skills to connect with it. Furthermore, looking back on my first submission, it appears I did not include the Director's Statement that I had produced, so double-checking my submissions will be another aspect that I would note.

              <p class="text-justify">
                <br>
                My role in Deepak's film is to be the lighting and sound artist. As such, I am the one who set up the lighting in his shots as well as the one to operate boom pole.
                <br><br>
                My objectives changed in that some scenes were improvised and as such was required to adapt to the new plans and adjust.
                <br><br>
                In the final outcome, some parts of the boompole were quite static and humming, which may have affected the audio even post-edit.
                <br><br>
                I have learnt more about how the boom pole operates and such will utilise it more effectively in the future especially outdoors.

              <p class="text-justify">
                <br>
                My role in Harry's film is to be the production designer. As such, I am the one who set up the scene, fixing positioning and making sure the focus was focused.
                <br><br>
                The objectives altered once moving shots came into picture, having to alter the set's design to compensate.
                <br><br>
                Some of the scenes may have been shaky, partly my fault for not cleaning the floors.
                <br><br>
                I will make sure the set is neat and tidy before shooting.

              <p class="text-justify">
                <br>
                I had multiple roles in Josh's film. I had to setup the set, operate the boompole and play as an extra.
                <br><br>
                The objectives changed as some actors, (not in the group,) were unable to attend, and as such had to improvise some of the roles and shots.
                <br><br>
                In the final outcome, it is quite evident that quite a few hours have passed based on the sky.
                <br><br>
                As such, making sure of the availabilities and working quicker will increase the process.

              <h6>Assistant Director, Actor</h6>
              <p class="text-justify">
                <br>
                I had multiple roles in Ali's film. I had to help him direct, as well as play the secondary role of the film.
                <br><br>
                The objectives have changed as Ali's recording took place on the last week, meaning I had to adjust my time management as I was dealing with five assignments at the same time.
                <br><br>
                In the final outcome, the film does seem quite rushed and would definitely have helped if more people came to help and done earlier
                <br><br>
                Next time, if someone is lagging behind, I will make sure to be firm and contact them to avoid last-second attempts.
