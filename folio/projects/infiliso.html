            <h5>Project Summary</h5>
            <h6>Director + Pitch Animator</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">
              <br>
              Being the director, I have created a story with a tone and message conveyed through its characters and setting, which I will with my team to materialise the concept. Meanwhile, as an animator, I will work with the head animator and other animators in the animation process through the creation of key frames, inbetweening frames and adding detail onto the designs of the scenes.
              <br><br>
              During the pre-production stage, the objectives included in my case was overseeing the progress of the rest of my crew, assist in the screenwriting and storyboarding of the final film whilst animating the sizzle reel.
              <br><br>
              Infiltrated Isolation is a film that explores abandonment and loneliness as an astronaut is left stranded in space with only his own gear and a spaceship to keep him company, and how the desperation for company can lead to poor decision-making.
              <br><br>
              All throughout the ideation and early stages of the film, many changes were made and some are still in dispute, many occurring due to organisational issues at the commencement of the year. For example, whether or not the, "infiltrator," should be an oranic alien creature or a rogue computer virus.

            <h5>Development</h5>
            <h6>Product and Reflection</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">
              <br>
              In terms of direction, the final script and storyboard still require a few tweaks and adjustments and discussion within the production team to be finalised. I will work with my colleagues to iron it out as soon as possible to get progress up to date. Once these clogs have been cleansed, the production will run much smoother and be more streamlined.
              <br><br>
              The sizzle reel has performed quite well and I am happy with it, with the two frame per second working better than I anticipated. However, it could still have been improved with more work put into and a more consistent art style between the three animators working on it. In addition, the sound design could have been touched upon more, possibly extra reverbs and fixing the timing of some sounds.
              <br><br>
              From my experience throughout the semester, I have improved my skillset in direction, and will continue improving and honing my skills up to the finalisation of the project. I will be more stern and diligent in my vision, and communicate it more clearly through both words and actions whilst taking into consideration other's input, being that of teammates, peers and supervisors.

              <br>
              The Capstone project was aimed to tell a story about an astronaut alone in space that is manipulated by a new foreign entity into giving it powers over the spacecraft until it turns on the poor space dweller. It was originally going to be presented with a <i>small man, big world</i> vision, which would have consisted of large, expansive rooms with the protagonist being minute compared to the surrounding area, being stuck in a spatially vast yet psychologically claustrophobic environment. I wished for it to be so as it in my mind would add to the dread of the astronaut’s situation in a twisted surreal horror that breaks an individual.
              <br><br>
              While the <i>small man, big world</i> for the most part was scrapped in the final project, the main themes of loneliness and naïveté are still very much present and are still the core of the film and its message. Furthermore, with Liam’s animation style, a sprinkle of comedy was added to the project, mainly during the rising tension or calm before the storm segment of the story. Whilst it swayed away from the original plans of the film, it brings in a new type of charm that Liam specialises in. Furthermore, the removal of the <i>small man, big world</i> was able to alleviate stress from Bora’s role as a background designer, as he would have had an extensive number of objects to model and arrange for the sake of the project. Overall, given our time, resources and expertise, these changes are necessary to ensure that we were able to complete the assignment around the scheduled due date whilst dealing with the other life events and classwork regarding other subjects.

            <h6>Final Outcome</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">
              <br>
              The final edit of the film, while far from perfect, is a film that I am proud of.
              <br><br>
              I believe the 2D and the 3D of the film were able to blend in nicely and that the scenes that worked, fit in perfectly like puzzle pieces. My main issues with the film would be the pacing of some scenes as well as the sound design in general.
              <br><br>
              For example, I believe the final chase scene was rushed, especially in the case of the resolution where he kicks the alien out of the escape pod, but also present in other areas like the scene where he reaches the terminal and tries to flame the alien without any prior interaction.
              <br><br>
              In the case of sound design, many sound effects and song choices were rushed and audio in my opinion is definitely the weakest element of the film.

            <h5>Critique</h5>
            <h6>Personal Outcome</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">
              <br>
              I could have done better as the director of the film, making sure that the animation and backgrounds stayed truer to the scripted story. This would have worked especially well if I were more inclined to pursue the original <i>small man, big world</i> vision.
              <br><br>
              However, I believe I was able to perform well with the edit, being able to set up the sequence of events, lengthen and shorten scenes, and play around with the frames animated and coloured by Liam and Josh.
              <br><br>
              Despite the industry standard of animation consisting of a twenty-four frame per second product with an individual cel of animation taking up two frames, Liam’s style allowed me to change the length of every frame. As such, I would typically use four or five frames per cel, which would be about a sixth of a second for most limited animations, whilst action shots would take up the standard two frames, and idle cels would range up to six or ten frames.
              <br><br>
              Finally, as one of the animators, I created the vector animations around the space ship screens as well as the opening title sequence with the asteroid being collected and cut up.

            <h5>Summary of Learnt Processes</h5>
            <h6>& What I Would Change</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">
              <br>
              From the endeavour of Capstone, I have been able to enhance my skills particularly in the fields of directing and editing, being particularly more confident in those attributes of filmmaking over time. As such, many different aspects that I have learnt throughout the process could have been applied to the early stages so that the cogs of the machine would have run smoothly from its commencement.
              <br><br>
              I have learnt to be more assertive as a director, whilst also being able to make decisions based on the opinions of the group, so that the numerous ideas of the group could filtered and funneled out to the best of my ability, while controlling said funnel as to fit the message that I aim to strive for. Furthermore, I believe that I have enhanced my editing skills greatly, being able to play around clips to increase their impact based on the time I allocate to each moment in particular and trying to find the correct balance of a making a scene last long enough for viewers to enjoy and appreciate but also not over-welcoming its stay. Extra experience with matching the visuals in the audio is also useful, but that field has already been mostly covered by the sound designers and their line of work.
              <br><br>
              As I commented earlier, I could have made more thought-out decisions towards the beginning of the project’s creation, so that the final film’s production and runtime performed to an excellent standard. For example, I would have made sure that the team was more informed with my decision-making and how my thought process functions in regard to the formation of key ideas and concepts of the project. This would have allowed the production stage of the film to kickstart much earlier and as such would have contributed more to the excellent standard that I had strived for. In addition, I would have also initiated the final edit earlier with the animatics so that I would be able to fit the pieces earlier on so that the fully rendered animations could have been fit into the scaffolding easier and influenced upcoming animation choices.
