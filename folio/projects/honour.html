            <h5>Writer</h5>
            <h6>Draft 1</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">
              <br>
              I created the first draft for Shattered Honour, moulding the characters and story to fit the narrative I wanted to tell, a story of tragedy and loss. This was later, revised by Mark into the current script which cut some scenes and included more dialogue. This draft was generated from Deepak's ideas, who first brought about the idea of creating a tale about PTSD and warfare.
              <br><br>
              Creating the characters required a lot of thought and care, as I wanted to create a compelling lead that experienced massive amounts of loss and in turn, found themselves felt lost in life. In writing the script, I didn't want it to be focused solely on war, but the main message being to people who have gone through loss, or just people who feel that they cannot become better.
              <br><br>
              Writing a message that can be taken to different conclusions based on the viewer's perception has been my priority. A cube with everyone looking at different faces but still manages to hold itself together and turn itself so everyone can also see each other's point of view.

            <p class="text-justify">
              Creating the world was also another interesting challenge, building a world with similar problems to ours but doesn't collide with it. The reason for making a new nation from scratch is that I did not want to create a war story that may infringe in real-life politics and cause any unnecessary controversy.
              <br><br>
              The name of the nation itself, <i>Mangan</i>, was derived from the Bundjalung word <i>Man.gan</i>, which translates to snake in English. It was intentional foreshadowing to the reveal planned later on that they had lied to their population about the state of affairs. Furthermore, the to-be-mentioned enemy state, <i>the Gulgin Republic</i> is derived of the same language's word, <i>gulgih</i>, which refers to <i>another or others</i>.

              <h5>Actor</h5>
              <h6>Dr. Lucas</h6>
              <p class="text-justify">
                <br>
                During the therapy scenes in the film, I played as James's personal therapist, Dr. Marcus Lucas. He is kind and caring, compassionate and takes it upon himself to ensure that James becomes the best man that he can be.
                <br><br>
                As such, I had to act as if understanding, and listen to the patient's words consideringly. Furthermore, based on the dialogue I was given, I was to provide dialogue on how James should take better care of himself, and ask him questions about his personal life.
                <br><br>
                Of course, as has been pointed out by my lecturer, the therapist should have much less lines than what I had, and as a writer I know that I should have proofread the current draft to make sure that my lines would be decreased to add to James's perspective more. Because, as pointed out, while a therapist may have a solution, it is their job to direct their patient rather than giving them it.

              <h5>Title Sequence Designer</h5>
              <h6>Opening + Credits Sequence</h6>
              <p class="text-justify">
                <br>
                To add flare to the project, I decided to create a captivating title sequence and ending to hook and immerse the audience. This was also in my opinion, the optimal place to put some subtle world-building that breathes life into the setting and giving glimpses into the nation of Mangan.
                <br><br>
                For the opening, I used some bonus shots that we decided not to add into the film, as well as some of my own to give a glimpse into the home life of James. Covered photos to show loss, empty alcohol bottles and the spinning globe representing that the world still goes on, a green tint was used throughout this sequence to convey the militaristic theme that the film is trying to represent.
                <br><br>
                In addition, for the title card animation, I replicated a TV screen screen, which aims to show what Manganese television and propaganda looks like. Inspired from Emergency Alert Systems, the background of the title containins the nation's coat of arms as well as the words, <i>Mangan Imperial Senate</i>, to give the insight of how the government of Mangan displays itself.
                <br><br>
                Designing the coat of arms was interesting, as I wanted to convey a nation that showed itself as heavenly, but corrupt to the core in the background. As such I was prompted by the Garden of Eden story, the snake that tempts Eve to eat the forbidden fruit and used it in my design, an apple, a tree and two snakes, which design-wise was stimulated by the symbol of Hermes, the Caduceus.
                <br><br>
                Finally, to warp up the video, I provided a credits roll with an image of James's enlistment form in the back. Creating the form required me to take inspiration from modern day enlistment forms from nations such as the United States of America, as well as historical documents such as World War I British enlistments.

          <div class="col-6 my-auto px-4 p-5">
            <p class="text-justify">
              In short, I believe the assignment was incredible, filming was completed very early on, and performances significantly improved from the last project.
              <br><br>
              Of course, there are many things that could have been altered, but we were confident enough in this short feature and thought that it would be worthy to enter into a film festival, and as such was entered into <i>Made in the West</i>.
              <br><br>
              The flow of work for this subject was smooth, the group each did their parts very well and played around our constraints. The group never had any major disagreements that set us back, nor any drama that broke us apart.
            </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-6 my-auto px-4 p-5">
            <p class="text-justify">
              I believe that I had gone on to achieve what I wanted to in terms of world-building, even if it is only minor in this film. I believe that it gives the audience a glimpse of what can be elaborated if turned into a full series.
              <br><br>
              Design-wise, I'm glad that I managed to execute what I did, I feel really proud with the Coat of Arms, Emergency Alert System and Enlistment Form, doing little to no change if I were to recreate this in the future.
              <br><br>
              I'm glad that Maryella was able to see what I was trying to achieve with the enlistment form, showing James's individuality and that he is a person with history, a record and a person just like everyone else.

              <p class="text-justify">
                Of course, no movie is without sin, and there are numerous issues that could have been implemented to improve it.
                <br><br>
                In terms of the opening, I really would like to have put more emphasis on our studio name, <i>the Minorities</i>, with 3D models, dramatic lighting and a well edited closeup to brand ourselves. However, unfortunately the amount of assignments piled up, and I could not find the time to design, model, rig and animate a logo.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, in the case of my acting, as stated previously, a solution, it is their job to direct their patient rather than giving them it. As well as cleaning the script, I should also have rehearsed the lines I was given more to improve upon my performance.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-6 my-auto px-4 p-5">
            <div class="row">
              <p class="text-justify">
                As the screenwriter, I have also felt as if Mark's final draft did not live up to the expectations of my original. Our writing styles vary quite a lot, with him producing large lines of dialogue or even monologue while I like to blend actions, timing and speech.
                <br><br>
                For example, Laurence's death scene could have been improved significantally, as I originally gave no dialogue to this scene, bullet shot and he's gone just like that, with James in shock as he doesn't expect life to disappear this quickly.
                <br><br>
                Getting my vision across is important, and I really should have emphasised my disagreements with the final draft to provide the best work possible and find the middle ground between Mark and I.
