            <h5>Animator</h5>
            <h6>Titlescreen + McAdobe Logo</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">
              <br>
              Both Liam and I worked on the animation, I worked on animations within the beginning and he worked towards the end, specifically the credits sequence.
              <br><br>
              I have decided to animate this arrange solely on <i>Adobe AfterEffects</i>, with some graphics being initially made then imported from <i>Illustrator</i>. During the process, I have gained a better grasp of <i>AfterEffects</i>, being able to utilise more aspects of it such as the trim path, mask and glow effects.
              <br><br>
              The first half of the titlecard, where it displays, <i>Sold</i>, is based on stock graphs, and as such uses a mixture of a bar and line graph. To represent such graphic, I have used blue for both the bars and grid in the background as well as orange for the line, and while I believe the colour scheme does work, it does fall into the cliché of orange and blue being overused in movie graphics.
              <br><br>
              Within the second half of the titlecard, where it transitions to, <i>Saved</i>, I have implemented and animated a similar graphic to the presentation slide designed by Harry. However, during the presentation, the tree remains tiny whilst it grows in size during this animation, representing the growth that comes through change.
              <br><br>
              In terms of audio, I have not focused too much, quickly adding sound effects found around the internet like office ambiance and chirping birds, as AfterEffects was not the optimal program to alter this aspect of media but also due to me having to deal with other assignments, not allowing me to do the extra step. However, Deepak was able to upgrade this during the final edit, adding the vocals in the background, which induces drama and suspense.
              <br><br>
              Looking towards the future, I will improve on my post-production audio skillset, learning <i>Adobe Audition</i> as well as improving my <i>AfterEffects</i> prowess, making the animations more smooth and satisfying.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-6 my-auto px-4 p-5">
            <p class="text-justify">
              Furthermore, I have also developed the 3D animated logo for <i>McAdobe</i>, Deepak's personal photography and editing page on both <i>Instagram</i> and <i>Tiktok</i>.
              <br><br>
              I created it in <i>Autodesk Maya</i>, an industry standard 3D animation software, and have done so to implement two types of animation in this project. Modelling it was quite simple, especially as the scene is very dark and I only needed to emphasise the logo colours and shape and did not take too long. The Main issue was creating fog, as I have been unable to render rolling fog as initially planned, which would have looked far more realistic as possible.
              <br><br>
              Of course the inspiration for creating the scene was a <i>McDonald's</i> restaurant, along with the unmistakable arches that takes the attention of all. The colours, similar to the colours Deepak already originally had in his logo are based on the colour scheme of the <i>AfterEffects</i> application logo. Furthermore, the buildings shown in the back are previous models of mine and as such, technically everything in this scene is purely my own work.
              <br><br>
              Of course both Deepak and I realise that <i>McAdobe</i> will not be suitable for long-term production as it violates the copyright of both <i>McDonald's</i> and <i>Adobe</i>, and due to this fact, are in the process of brainstorming a new production name.

              <h6>Greedy Businessman</h6>
              <p class="text-justify">
                <br>
                Alongside Bora, Josh and Liam, I have played one of the businessmen within the meeting scene, specifically the greedy one.
                <br><br>
                As such, I had to act as if I was superior to everyone else in the room, and get mad at anything that goes against my interests, notably Billy's remarks on putting the environment before wealth. Unfortunately however, I was not given much lines and as such could not serve more of a purpose in this scene and I believe that I should have had more lines and screentime so that the scene would have flowed more seamlessly, as back and forth dialogue is more preferred in my opinion compared to theatric monologues, at least in a short film like this.
                <br><br>
                As such, I have decided to do more non-verbal gestures such as twitching my eye in annoyance and scrunching a piece of paper in anger, responding to the comments given by the characters of Billy and Ned, which unfortunately seem to not have been picked up in-camera. In retrospect, I was supposed to have an introduction scene which was cut due to situational events relating to Bora and later Josh, however I still felt as if my character should have been done more justice, at least within a speaking role, showing more of his viewpoints and then shut down and why they are morally wrong.
                <br><br>
                Funnily enough, this scene was filmed during <i>ANZAC Day</i>, during the mid-semester break, before the proposal was due, and honestly it was optimal timing as the <i>Parramatta City Campus</i> was basically empty, meaning our filming had minimal disruption and we could finish much sooner than anticipated. Furthermore, it allowed us to finish a massive chunk of our filming before the incidents with Josh and Bora, and as such being ahead of schedule significantly saved our production from going downhill extremely fast.

                <br>
                Finally, as to complete the cross-platform aspect of the assignment, I have posted several posts relating to the Behind the Scenes shoots and some of the animations crafted by Liam and I on an Instagram page, @menwhosavedtheworldofficial, created by Mark.
                <br><br>
                The Behind the Scenes were filmed at regular periods by Mark, Liam and Eric throughout the entirety of the shootings which have showed our processes before shooting, such as our rehearsals, the setting up of equipment, and funny moments that have happened in-between.
                <br><br>
                To improve on this aspect in the future, I will begin to create the page or similar element at an earlier stage, allowing the workflow to run smoothly. In addition, I would also add more interactivity, such as personality quizzes or polls relating to the characters and such which would garner attention from potential audiences.

                <br>
                Prior to shooting, as well as during scenes where I am not visible, I have worked in the background, helping Deepak, Mark and Harry conduct their roles to their greatest ability and making sure everything is in order on set.
                <br><br>
                As such, I have been setting up equipment such as lights, audio and others of the sort to get the filming done and over with while spirits are high and wills are strong. I have also gained a greater sense on how chaotic sets can become and navigating through one.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, I was operating the boom pole as well during Ned and Billy's Presentation. In that aspect, it was troubling finding an area where the boom could effectively be kept without casting a shadow in the background or disrupting the vision of the camera, but it worked out fine in the end.

              In short, I believe the assignment went incredibly smoothly. Of course, there are many things that could have been altered, refined and perfected into a short feature that would be worthy to enter into a film festival, but with our constraints and setbacks, a wonderful product emerged from these circumstances.
              <br><br>
              A predetermined group is a major reason for this, I have previously worked with Harry, Deepak and Josh in the previous semester, creating four short films under the theme of identity. As such, we have learnt the strengths and weaknesses of one another and have developed a very tight bond.
              <br><br>
              The roles I have chosen this semester, as detailed above, consist of animator, actor, social media manager and production assistant.
              <br><br>
              I have chosen such roles as I wanted to do a bit of everything, expanding my skillset across multiple areas through the multimedia landscape and benefiting the production as much as possible. I chose to animate as I believe the film need some flair and to highlight the title so that it is embedded into the minds of the audience. Additionally, I acted as Eric was unavailable during that time and the business meeting required quite a bit of people as well as not having acted nor worn formal attire for a while, and decided to do it for fun. Choosing to be social media manager is my most reluctant role out of the four, but it was quite entertaining to post and write a fun little description underneath. Finally, the process of filming, while tiring at times, is very enjoyable to participate in, which is the reason I was present for all shootings, and as such I took the role of production assistant to make sure production goes as smoothly as possible with no hiccups and hinders which could cost much-valued time.
              <br><br>
              In my roles, I have not so much learnt how to do something new, as I have expanded on the current skills that I have. I have managed to improve my abilities on <i>AfterEffects</i> as well as relearning <i>Maya/</i>, which I have not used for a period of time. However, learning to make a socal media page promoting a film was interesting, as I researched other marketing examples, notably <a href="https://www.instagram.com/freeguymovie" target="_self"><u>@freeguymovie</u></a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/smilemovie" target="_self"><u>@smilemovie</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/madmaxmovie" target="_self"><u>@madmaxmovie</u></a>.
              <br><br>
              Whilst Josh and Bora were unavailable during the later stages of the production, I was unavailable during the early stages as I was hired to do contract work for the <i>NSW Electoral Commission</i> during the <i>2023 NSW State Election</i>. As such, I was unable to do much of the planning and writing of the assignment, which may have allowed the production to go more smoothly and the flow of the story to be exponentially stronger.
              <br><br>
              However, this does not mean that I did not try. Despite my tight schedule, I have written two scripts during the early stages:
              <br><br>
              My first script, titled, <a href="assets/download/soldsaved-1.pdf" target="_self"><i><u>How the Mighty Fall</u></i></a>, detailed an aging businessman who has caused severe damage to the ecosystem, realising his mortality and reflecting on his actions. After a business meeting, Reginald is met by a stranger from his childhood who berates him and mocks him, tugging on his insecurities that Reginald has hoarded over the decades. Eventually, it is revealed that this mysterious figure is none other than the personification of his humanity, who he has tried to surpress during his prime years, who has come to ultimately urge Reginald to rethink his life and repair his relationships and the world to the best of his ability before his passing. In this proposed film, I had hoped to mix both the world's environment as well as the human environment to create a poetic story about how the worst in society may have some heart inside them. Ultimately, the script in a production sense is basic, as it revolved around only two characters in a singular location. Due to this fact, Deepak declined the proposed draft, but I believe the businessman aspect of this inspired what would later become Mark's work, the current story.
              <br><br>
              My second script, titled, <a href="assets/download/soldsaved-2.pdf" target="_self"><i><u>Tree of Life</u></i></a>, is a revision of Eric's original script, and as such features the familiar characters, Ned and Billy's school life. Originally, Billy was a bully and Ned a victim of Billy. Ned was constantly bullied by Billy after he suspects Ned of snitching on him, and makes his life a living hell. After Ned finally retaliates, which causes the disrupts the class, the teacher forces Ned and Billy to work together on an assignment. Finally, this allows them to connect, where Ned learns that Billy is actually a victim of abuse from his father, who favours his overachiever of a sister over him, and that his father's actions are mirrored through Billy as the apple seems to not fall far from the tree, which has caused Billy to drop in grades despite being a bright student in his earlier years. Finally, after ending up on the same page, Ned and Billy cooperate to create the liquid tree, with the film finishing on the presentation scene, where Ned and Billy finally showcase their proposal of a product. I enjoyed this story, as there were multiple locations present compared the first draft, which allowed for a larger sense of scale and finality, as well as seeing the two characters settle their differences through words and actions, with a conflict that is less one-sided to the current film. Whilst this was a close contender to the final script, Deepak eventually chose Mark and Eric's script.

              Although personally, I wished that one of my scripts was used, I respect Deepak's decision in utilising Mark and Eric's script and am quite happy with how they have been implemented into the final product. I know that both Eric and Mark have taken great effort and take the extra step into researching about the environment and creating solutions rather than the easy route that many filmmakers take which is fearmongering.

              Overall, this semester is an amazing learning experience and I believe that this project is a stepping stone for an outstanding future film. The group I have worked with is amazing and now that we have learnt our dynamics and how we bounce of one another in workflow, the next film we produce together will undoubtedly be amazing. The cards have been dealt, now it is time to go all in!
