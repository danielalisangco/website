            <p class="text-justify">
              <br>
              In all sets, before the cameras were rolling, I took the responsibility of production designer, setting up what is to be filmed.
              <br><br>
              I contributed directly with Harry to ensure that his vision was met with the upmost standards. I used the shots displayed to ensure that the intervierwee's faces are clearly visible as well as keeping it cinematic.
              <br><br>
              Key issues I have had to deal with is how the space present in a scene, especially if its a tight area like a bedroom or classroom, as the positioning of furniture and objects weren't only important as to look great on screen, but also to make it easy for crew members and guests to navigate the space with minimal disruption.
              <br><br>
              Overall, the role went smoothly as there was nothing incredibly difficult to manage, as all sets were already clean and tidy.

              Sarah Jane's house was the easiest to change, as most of the objects were perfectly set and matched with the child-like theme of the interview. Setting up and dismantling the set in her house was quick and easy, only requiring Harry, Josh, Luka and I to be present, as well as being completed in under two hours.
              <br><br>
              In the interview with Brittany, the set originally was to be situated within a classroom, but changed to what can be seen now as the natural background is preferable compared to a cold, formal classroom. As such, the set had to be changed quickly, as our interviewee is a very busy person, and precious time could not be wasted. The area we shot was almost perfect, the only downside was the fallen leaves which littered the floor, generating crunch if stepped on, therefore all personnel within the vicinity could not move their legs during shooting, which caused uncomfortability.
              <br><br>
              Within the classroom, I have chosen to set up the background in such a way that adds a sense of nature, such as moving the plants behind the speakers to add a sense of nature as finding colourful items within the classroom to position behind them. As such, despite the horrors of what may come, there is still brightness in the dark. Furthermore, adjusting the location of tables and chairs in a small classroom to create the perfect flow for people to enter and exit the classroom was also a small issue that had to worked around.

                During the actual interview period, I have been in charge of recording the audio, making sure that every single word that leaves the interviewee's lips are picked up and stored for further editing. In some cases, Eric assisted me in the role, such as holding the boom pole while I hit the record button or vice versa. When using multiple audio inputs that do not match in volume, I've had to mix them as well as positioning the boom pole in a location where other sources of sound may disrupt the recording.
                <br><br>
                Lavalier microphones were used in the entirety of the production, having a spare one in case of malfunction of the first one, or as demonstrated with Tiana and Subeer, in case of a dual interview. However, throughout the filming of both Sarah Jane and Brittany, the boom pole was used as an extra precaution if the lapel broke down. Fortunately, the audio recording never faultered and at least in the sound department, nothing seemed to go wrong.

              Despite a few hiccups, the production of the assignment went quite well, the workload was streamlined and shooting was incredibly smooth in general. Filming in locations were surprisingly very quick, and all of our interviewees were respectful and polite, some children being much more amazingly educated in the subject than I would have ever anticipated.
              <br><br>
              This entire production has also displayed to me a side of Harry that I never expected, he was soft-spoken with the children, very patient and handled them very well. It has also inspired me to take more care into presenting myself as a welcoming individual, which would help in getting assistance in my work and networking for future projects. Furthermore, having to complete the legalities to even film the assignment, such as the <i>Working with Children Check</i> have opened my eye to potential paperwork I may have to complete in future projects.
              <br><br>
              Unfavourably for me, for the pre-production stages of the film, I was undergoing full-time contract work in a four-week period. As such, despite me being listed as a writer in some of the earlier proposals, I have not been able to complete my duties properly, only handing out some faint advice and barely working on the questions.
              <br><br>
              Retrospectively, I believe that if I had taken a stronger approach in the writing field of the project, I could settle some of the fundamental issues I have with its presentation, as my biggest critique on the film is the tone. Throughout the film, the tone does fluctuate a bit, the most jarring being the credits, as it switches from an impending, fear-inducing doomsday clock immediately to a cutsie, happy, carefree background which completely breaks the tension placed upon by the scene previous to it. This is not the fault of Liam however, as having spoken to him, I have concluded that he was not given a proper tone to work with, thus resorting to the credits sequence currently present, which is amazing but does not match the tone set by the film in general.
              <br><br>
              Due to this, I have taken it upon myself to attend every single shooting possible and ensure that everything in the production belt is working properly to avoid mishaps and wasted time. As such, I basically know how to set every piece of equipment used excluding the Blackmagic Camera and Field Monitor, allowing for a quick passage of time for filming, allowing everyone to not be drained as time drags and ensuring continuity with the change of the daylight cycle.
